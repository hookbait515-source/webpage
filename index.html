        The website that I chose is sdbullion.com. Its a business website where users can buy a variety of precious metals such as gold, silver, titanium etc. Upon entering the website your brought to the home page where in the body you see new offers as well as the current spot prices for the metals. There is a dropdown menu for each metal in the header where you can see the specifics on that one metal as well as some other help menus.

        What I like most about the website is the simplicity of the UI. Of any online precious metals vendors they have the easiest website to navigate. You can easily select whichever of the metals you are interested in and see important details on them. Theres a graph representing the change in prices over time which makes it easier to make good investing decisions.
